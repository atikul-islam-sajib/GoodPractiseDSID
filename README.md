   - Command: `!git clone https://github.com/atikul-islam-sajib/GoodPractiseDSID.git`
   - Purpose: Retrieves the necessary code and datasets from a GitHub repository.

2. **Setting Working Directory**: 
   - Command: `%cd /content/GoodPractiseDSID`
   - Purpose: Navigates to the cloned repository directory to access files and scripts.

3. **Installing Dependencies**: 
   - Command: `!pip install Augmentor`
   - Purpose: Installs the 'Augmentor' package, a necessary dependency for data augmentation.

4. **Training the Classifier**: 
   - Command: `!python alzheimer/classifier/classifier.py --dataset /content/dataset.zip --batch_size 64 --model --epochs 500 --lr 0.001 --device gpu`
   - Purpose: Executes a classifier training script with specified parameters like dataset path, batch size, model type, number of epochs, learning rate, and computation device.

5. **Generating Metrics**: 
   - Command: `!python alzheimer/classifier/classifier.py --get_all_metrics --device gpu`
   - Purpose: Runs a script to compute and display various performance metrics of the trained model.

   - Purpose: Generates charts to visualize aspects like training history and model predictions.

7. **Displaying Results**: 
   - Commands:
     - `Image('/content/GoodPractiseDSID/alzheimer/figures/image_prediction.png',)`
     - `Image('/content/GoodPractiseDSID/alzheimer/figures/training_history.png')`
     - `Image('/content/GoodPractiseDSID/alzheimer/figures/confusion_metrics.png')`

## Prerequisites
For optimal utilization of this notebook, the following are required:
- **Python Version**: Python 3.9 or higher.
- **Execution Environment**: pip install -r requirements.txt.
- **Libraries and Packages**: Core libraries including torch, with additional dependencies as specified within the notebook.

### Detailed Implementation Steps: Importing modules

1. **Importing Modules for Alzheimer's Analysis**:
   - Code:
     ```python
     from alzheimer.data.data_loader import Dataloader
     from alzheimer.features.build_features import FeatureBuilder
     from alzheimer.models.train_model import Trainer
     from alzheimer.models.model import Classifier
     from alzheimer.visualization.visualize import ChartManager
     ```
   - Purpose: Imports specific modules for data loading, feature building, model training, classification, and visualization tailored for Alzheimer's disease data analysis.

2. **Unzipping the Dataset**:
   - Code:
     ```python
     loader = Dataloader(zip_file='/content/dataset.zip')
     loader.unzip_dataset()
     ```
   - Purpose: Initializes the data loader and extracts the dataset from a zipped file, making it ready for processing.

3. **Feature Creation**:
   - Code:
     ```python
     build_features = FeatureBuilder()
     build_features.build_feature()
     loader.extract_feature()
     ```
   - Purpose: Constructs and extracts relevant features from the dataset, essential for training the classifier.

4. **Model Initialization**:
   - Code:
     ```python
     import torch
     device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
     clf = Classifier()
     model_trainer = Trainer(classifier=clf, device=device, lr=0.001)
     ```
   - Purpose: Sets up the computing device (GPU/CPU), initializes the classifier, and prepares the training environment with specified learning rate.

5. **Training the Model**:
   - Code:
     ```python
     model_trainer.train(epochs=100)
     ```
   - Purpose: Commences the training process of the classifier for a specified number of epochs.

6. **Model Performance Evaluation**:
   - Code:
     ```python
     model_evaluation, model_clf_report = model_trainer.model_performance()
     print(model_evaluation)
     print(model_clf_report)
     ```
   - Purpose: Evaluates the trained model, providing detailed performance metrics and classification reports for analysis.

7. **Visualization with ChartManager**:
   - Code:
     ```python
     charts = ChartManager()
     charts.plot_image_predictions()
     charts.plot_training_history()
     charts.plot_confusion_metrics()
     ```
   - Purpose: Utilizes the 'ChartManager' for generating visualizations. This includes plotting image predictions, training history, and confusion metrics, providing a graphical representation of the model's performance and accuracy.
